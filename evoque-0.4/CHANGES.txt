$begin{changelog}


### 0.4 (2009-01-21):

- Evoque (package/unittests) now runs on all of python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 3.0,
  simultaneously from the same identical code base.
- The decodeh module (encoding guessing algorithm, now even more important in
  py3 when opening text files) becomes py3-aware by:  
    - making read_from_file() always opens a file in binary mode  
    - handling bytes as the non-unicode str case in py3
- Tighter lockdown of the in-process sandbox (thanks to Daniel Diniz for 
  feedback and additional testing) by:  
    - fail for all expressions that include lookups for attributes starting 
      with any of: "__", "func_", "f_", "im_", "tb_", "gi_", "throw"
    - added "object" to the disallowed list of builtins
- Changed behaviour of the Domain init parameter slurpy_directives=True, that 
  now behaves in the following way: for each directive, strip all 
  leading/trailing whitespace on the same line plus (on left) the initial 
  newline -- if and only if the end of the line being slurped is made up of 
  only whitespace.
- Added whitespace test case.
- Updated to qpy 1.7.
- In the unit tests, replaced hash(s) as a shorthand way to compare strings
  with explicit strings. 
- Corrected problem with yield and try/finally that was breaking 
  Template.test() under python 2.4.
- In restricted mode, when initializing the globals namespace under 
  python 2.4, the issubclass check is done against Exception as opposed 
  to BaseException (that is not available in 2.4).


### 0.3 (2008-09-06):

- All overlay keyword parameters may now be evaluated at runtime (in the same 
  way as for the evoque directive); in addition to the first "name" parameter, 
  the other parameters of the overlay directive [src, collection, space] may 
  now also be set to a variable for evaluation at runtime. 
- Runtime evaluation of the overlay directive now explicitly raises a 
  SyntaxError if a keyword parameter other than [name, src, collection, space]
  is specified. 
- Added labels, eval_overlay attributes to Template; removed overlay dict 
  as attribute, replaced with template.get_space_overlay() that dynamically 
  returns a (space:bool, overlay:dict) tuple on each call, where the returned
  overlay dict contains only parameters needed for calling get_template().
- Renamed Template methods reload() and reload_from_string() to 
  decode() and decode_from_string().
- Added possibility to specify a "local" src to $$evoque{} when addressing a
  template that is (a) named (b) file-based (c) nested and (d) within the 
  same collection; such src values must start with "#" and the calling 
  template's file is used to normalize the src 
  (see Evaluator.evoque()).
- Refined the check to determine whether a KeyError during evaluation is 
  really coming from the evaluator's lookup or from further down. 
- Changed Template.test() method to be a generator of template evaluations,
  thus resulting in that any successful evaluations prior to a first failure 
  are returned.


### 0.2 (2008-08-04):

- The name first parameter of the evoque and overlay directives i.e. 
  $$evoque{*name*} and $$overlay{*name*} may now be specified in one of the 
  following ways:
    - *an unquoted str arg* : interpreted literally
    - *a quoted str arg* : interpreted literally
    - *name=an unquoted str* : str is interpreted as variable name, and 
        evaluated at runtime within the template's context
    - *name=a quoted str* : interpreted literally
- Template.unload() now recurses and unloads also any local sub-templates.
- Adopted default logging to be standard python logger for "evoque".
- Changed to True as default value of the "output" parameter of the 
  builtin callable $${inspect(output=True)}.
- Rendering of templates with raw=True now correctly processes any specified
  post-evaluation filters.
  

### 0.1.2 (2008-07-27):

- Added ext/pylons for integrating Evoque with Pylons, both as documentation 
  (on web site) and as sample code (in distribution).
- Corrected problem with auto-refreshing of a template with a modified value
  for "data" in an embedded $$prefer{data=dict()} directive.
- Removed unused methods on Template: 
  set_locals(), set_on_locals(), set_namespace_on_locals()
- Improved benchmark suite, in particular added benchmarks for mako in 
  automatic quoting mode.
- decodeh.py: added catch of ValueError from locale.getdefaultlocale(), to be
  able to ignore exceptions of the form "ValueError: unknown locale: XXX" when
  the LANG or any LC_* env variables are set to an unknown locale. 
- decodeh.py: added global IGNORE_ENCS list, and added the non-existent "cp0" 
  encoding that is sometimes returned by Windows, thus avoiding a 
  "LookupError: unknown encoding: cp0" further downstream.


### 0.1.1 (2008-03-23):

- Fixed bug with top-level middle text (in between directive blocks) not 
  being parsed, see: test_mid_text().
- Some minor changes to parsing code, for better robustness and clarity.
- Added ext/django recipe, for using evoque with django.
- Added ext/qp/echo sample qp application.
- Added ext/werkzeug sample WSGI application.


### 0.1 (2008-03-07):

- First public release.
